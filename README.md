## About the Analysis

- Data was web scraped from Cricbuzz using Python and processed into structured JSON records.

- JSON data was cleaned and transformed into CSV files for visualization in Power BI. 

- Interactive Power BI dashboards were created with insights on:

  - Top batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders

  - Team-wise analytics and contributions

  - Tournament XI based on player rankings

  - The dashboards include filters to analyze by team, player, match and stages.


## Future Work

Some ways this analysis can be enhanced further:

- Expanding to other tournaments using the same data pipeline.

- Incorporating sentiment analysis of match commentary.

- Building ML models to predict match outcomes.
